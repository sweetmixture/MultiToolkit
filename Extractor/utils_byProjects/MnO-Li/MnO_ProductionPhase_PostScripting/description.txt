!
!   CoreConv   : supporting post-processing core-conv calculations 
!   ShellConv  : supporting post-processing shel-conv calculations
!
!   ShellConp  : typically shell-conp is the final phase calculation, in the directory, script 'KLMC_PoolGulpEx.py' is to summarise results in csv format
!   * generated 'csv' file is a standard form that could be used for further analysis:
!        (1) Freqeuncy analysis
!        (2) Radial distribution function
!        (3) X-ray diffraction simulations
!   * therefore, if further analysis is necessary, it is convenient to keep it !
!
!
!   all the details are in *.py scripts
