	1. mos_analyser_2.py : dumping selected states (+-8 from HOMO spin up/down) json files

		* writing KS vectors for the following states

			Au_sp: Au atom 'sp'
			Au_d : Au atom 'd'
			S_p  : S  atom 'p'
			O    : Others

			and save them in '.json' format: see 'selected_up/down.json'

		* deprecated scripts:
			mos_analyser.py
			mos_analyser_orbitals.py

	2. Transition.py
		
		* has dependency on 'ase.io.cube' module

		taking two inputs, possibly before/after transitions (FHIaims generated cubefiles)

		calculating transition intensity using transition dipolemoment

		(note that unit is not specifically adjusted) ... 06.06.2024

		* under '__main__' to see how this script is used

		see:/work/e05/e05/wkjee/Gold/cubes1/cubes on ARCHER2

	3. get_transitions_data.py

		* batch processing of 'Transition.py'

		to run this script, (1) generated 'selected_up/down.json' is required with 'cube'(dict_key) give path to cube files

		example 'selected_up/down.json' files are at:

			/work/e05/e05/wkjee/Software/MultiToolkit/Extractor/FHIaims_GoldNC_tools/updown_cube
			/work/e05/e05/wkjee/Software/MultiToolkit/Extractor/FHIaims_GoldNC_tools/updown_cube_local

		on ARCHER2

		! make sure that the path are in match with the desired path of the cube files.
		! also double check, if cubefiles are with corresponding KS eigen states
